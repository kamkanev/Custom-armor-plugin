# Custom-armor-plugin

This is a Minecraft plugin, containing 7 custom sets of armor.

  **Please star and share the project! ;)**

## Installation

**I recommend downloading the plugin from [spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/block-shuffle.89056/), because it's only the plugin `jar` file.**

But if you want you can download the project. And export it as a `.jar` file.

Then put the file in the plugin folder on your server. Make sure to **/reload** the server, so the plugin is enabled and running.

More information for how to install and use plugins you can find [here](https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Installing_Plugins).
